# My-Profesional-Portfolio
Summary:

For this challenge, I was tasked with making my own portfolio to show-off the work I have done and will do in the future. This is an invaluable asset to have as I move forward in this class and eventually am looking to show-off my work in search of a potential job. While I dont have much work yet, this website will allow me to easily update the links which I currently have with more impressive and ambitious projects that are sure to attract potential employers. It also is a nice place for people to contact me, given that my github, linkedin, and email are all easily accessible through the websites interface.

My Experience:

I definitely struggled with this challenge as my knowledge didn't allow me to reach the high standards I had going in; atleast not in regards of how the website looks. At the beginning I was focused primarily on getting a working website to show off my cat pictures, as Kai mentioned we could use pet pictures since we are lacking in projects with real sustenance at the moment. This took up most of my time and for hours, I struggled to figure out the layout mechanisms. Finally, I saw a linked video in the slack channel which showed a responsive grid layout. After watching the video and studying the code given, I was finally able to end up with a pretty decent product! My hero image is still very wonky but how it currently is, is the best I could figure out while maintaining its appearance while the screen size is smaller. Overall, this challenge was a huge learning experience. I realized that sometimes when you slow down and look for new solutions, you can effectively produce better results. This is invaluable to my experience as a programmer asin the early-stages of this challenge, I was just trying to brute-force my website into existence; rarely does such a thing payoff.
